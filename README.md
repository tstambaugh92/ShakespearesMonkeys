This is a small project I'm using to learn basic multithreading in C#.

The program simulates the "infinite monkey theorm", minus the infinite part. Each "monkey" mashes a guess until it matches the answer phrase given at the start of the program.

The number of monkeys generated is based on CPU cores. You can pass a fixed number via command line argument.
